# jpeg-bombs
simple ac-vulnurabilty exploits for which facebook refused to pay me a bounty
they are highly cpu/ram strainful and work both on fb and instegram without detection, causing huge server side strain on both fb and any user who opens it - it is cauysed because of the image handler fb uses, as of this date still isnt fixed.
use at your own risk.]\
i am not reponsible for any damage -only sharing for anyone who might benefit from this in terms of security patching
